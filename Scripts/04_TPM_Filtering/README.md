# TPM Filtering
The fourth step of this project is to filter the reads based on the TPM values:
For this we do the following:

-Estimate Transcript Abundance
-Build Transcript and Gene Expression Matrices
-Count the number of expressed Transcripts or Genes
-Filtering Transcripts Based on Expression Values
-Create New Trinity Gene Maps
