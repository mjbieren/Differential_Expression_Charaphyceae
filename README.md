# Differential Expression Charaphyceae
This overviews all (novel) tools and scripts we used in the Differential Expression Charaphyceae Project.
This GitHub does not contain the raw data we used and obtained (with some minor exceptions) during our Differential Expression Charaphyceae Project. For that, we would like to refer you to our Zenodo Link: [https://zenodo.org/records/10058795](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10822046)

# Introduction
Above. I've portrayed the Workflow in which the Differential Expression Charaphyceae Project was executed.
